## :computer: How it works

You can choose how you want to test, there are at least 2 easy ways and one a little more difficult.

The 2 easiest are:

* Using the Swagger (http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html), which is very intuitive;
* Or by the browser itself, placing the link you want to access in the URL:

The way I commented, which is a little more difficult, would be by Postman. But I didn't use it for testing, so I don't have a print to show how it works. However, it is also very intuitive if you want to test for it.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Improvements

There are several points of improvement for this project. However, there are two very important ones that I couldn't solve:

1. I couldn't find a free unlimited library or API for text translation. So I used RapidAPI, which was handy, but only allows for a few translations before it stops translating. In this case, the print of the percentage of use already enjoyed follows. If you stop translating, it's because you've reached your maximum.

1. Second, I couldn't get the two API keys I'm using stored elsewhere. I tried to solve this problem. But I didn't find a good quick fix that I could do in time.
